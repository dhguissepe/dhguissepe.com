          D.H. Guissepe stands for Daniel Hern√°ndez Guissepe. I offer my skills to work
          on open source JavaScript projects as a collaborator, and I share my knowledge as a
          web developer expert under that name.

          This idea firstly came when I wanted to leave a permanent mark on the Internet, in order to be
          seen anywhere at any time, to make a link between me and everyone else out there. Beyond those things,
          the main scope of D.H. Guissepe is to inspire all those newcomers in the tech world.
